### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am an embedded systems engineer. In my free time, I work on a few projects. My projects are mostly in the field of microcontrollers, and I also include a blog explaining the project in detail.

## Repositories

* I am well versed in **ARM cortex** microcontrollers and have written register-level code for my STM 32 F407 Discovery Board, which is available on the [STM32-F4]( https://github.com/daniboi16/STM32-F4) Repository.  
* I have also implemented a few Arduino projects that are available in the [Arduino-Code]( https://github.com/daniboi16/Arduino-Code) Repository. 
* I have also implemented a few basic projects on my FPGA board, the Altera Cyclone II EP2C5. I develop my projects in Verilog on the Altera Quartus II which can be found in the [ALTERA CYCLONE II]( https://github.com/daniboi16/ALTERA-CYCLONE-II) repository.
* There are 3 more repositories which I worked on:
    1. [Inventory-billing-system](https://github.com/daniboi16/Inventory-billing-system) which was a project I worked on to get a better grasp on Python file handling and Tkinter
    2. [ENERGY-METER](https://github.com/daniboi16/ENERGY-METER) which was a project in my bachelor's where I worked on IOT and automation.
    3. [Speech-Recognition](https://github.com/daniboi16/Speech-Recognition) which is also a project I worked on during my bachelor's where I worked with audio files in MATLAB
