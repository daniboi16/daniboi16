### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Hi I am an electrical and electronics engineer. I develop projects in the field of microcontrollers, FPGA, IOT, etc. Most of my projects are accoupled by its own blog.

## Highlights 

* I am well versed with **ARM cortex** microcontrollers and have written Register level code for my STM 32 F407 Discovery Board which is available on the [STM32-F4]( https://github.com/daniboi16/STM32-F4) Repository.  
* I have also implemented a few Arduino projects which are available in the [Arduino-Code]( https://github.com/daniboi16/Arduino-Code) Repositor. I have made a point not to use to many libraries and write code from scratch so as to get a better understanding. 
* I am also developing project on my FPGA board, the Altera Cyclone II EP2C5. I develop my projects with Verilog Code on the Altera Quartus II. Verilog codes can be found in the [ALTERA CYCLONE II]( https://github.com/daniboi16/ALTERA-CYCLONE-II) repository.

## Programming Language

* **Python**: I am well versed in Python and have more than 6 years of experience writing programs in python. I have 
* **Embedded C**: I am written many register Level codes for my STM 32 in embedded C
* **Verilog**: I implement all my FPGA projects using Verilog.
* **Java**: I have learned Java as part of my curriculum and received the highest grade in university.
